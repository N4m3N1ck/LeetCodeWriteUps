# Missing Number
Let's see what the array would look like if no numbers where missing. Let's choose n=5 and the missing number is 3. We will get [0,1,2,x,4,5]. The array contains n+1 elements and the first element of the array is 0, while the last element is n. We can calculate the sum using this formula: n*(n<sup>0</sup>+T<sup>n</sup>)/2
