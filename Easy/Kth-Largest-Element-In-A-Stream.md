# Kth Largest Element In A Stream
Initialize a minHeap of length k to store the k largest elements in nums. Remove the smallest elements from the heap until the length is equal to k. Each time we call add() we will add the current element, and remove the min element from the heap. The min element after calling add() will be the kth largest.
```python
class KthLargest:

    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        self.minHeap, self.k = nums, k
        heapq.heapify(self.minHeap)
        while len(self.minHeap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minHeap)
    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        heapq.heappush(self.minHeap, val)
        if len(self.minHeap) > self.k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minHeap)
        return self.minHeap[0]
        


# Your KthLargest object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = KthLargest(k, nums)
# param_1 = obj.add(val)
```
